# Executive Summary

R Markdown is a great way to turn your analysis into a portable, reproducible document - such as pdf or html. This document demonstrates how to incorporate Healths corporate style guide into Rmarkdown documents.

```{r results = 'asis', message=F, warning=F}
#library(openxlsx)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(scales)    # to show scale in percent
library(ggseas)    # for seasonal adjustment on the fly
library(forcats)   # for munging factors
library(extrafont) # in case running on windows
library(stringi)   # for generating pseudo lating lorem ipsum text
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(zoo)
library(scales)

#cat(stri_rand_lipsum(1))
```


# Purpose

This is basically just a demo of how to deal with a few issues with making R Markdown files comply with corporate styling - fonts, logo, heading sizes and colours, etc.  

The features include:

* logo in the top right of the document, and modify the title's width to allow for it
* heading styles and fonts in the html
* fonts and corporate colours used in the graphics
* document builds successfully even if the project is on a mapped network drive which usually causes problems with RStudio Server and Pandoc



# Analysis

## Data

The data presented are service volumes of the top 5 MBS items claimed by GP's.

## Findings

### Raw data

We see a very strong seasonal pattern, as well as step changes associated with step change increases in COVID related telehealth items and associated reduction in item 23 volumes.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

MBS <- read_csv(here('./GP_MBS_items.csv')) %>% 
  mutate(ITEM = as.factor(ITEM) 
         , month = as.yearmon(MONTH, "%b-%y")
         , TOTAL = TOTAL/1000000)


MBS %>% ggplot(aes(x = month, y = TOTAL, colour = ITEM)) + geom_line() + labs(y = "Services (millions)")
```


### Seasonally adjusted - item 23 volumes

We can perform a seasonal adjustment to removed the monthly fluctuation around the trend.


```{r, message=F, warning=F}
MBS %>% filter(ITEM==23) %>% ggplot(aes(x = month, y = TOTAL, colour = ITEM)) + geom_point() + labs(y = "Services (millions)") +
  stat_stl(frequency = 12, s.window = 7 , geom = 'line' ) +
  labs(y = "Seasonall adjusted services (millions)")

```
